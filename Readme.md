QB_Stats_Project
After all the records Tom Brady has broken, some people still somehow doubt that his passing game is the pivotal factor in how the Patriots score so many points and win so many games. This project is intended to show that if there is a linear, positive relationship between how many passing yards Tom Brady has versus how many points the team scores. By averaging Tom Brady's passing yards into three categories (0-150 yards, 151-300 yards, and 300+ yards), we can break down if there is a significant pattern of how many points are scored based on Brady's passing performance.

The data used is from a dataset that contains all of the NFL quarterback statistics from 1996-2016, retrieved from Kaggle.com.
